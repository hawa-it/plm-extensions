        h1 Prerequisites
        ul
            li This solution is based on the standard 
                strong Items 
                | workspace and its standard properties.
            li Spare parts get identified by the standard field 
                strong Spare Wear Part 
                | of workspace 
                strong Items
                |. If this property's value is set to 
                strong Spare Part 
                | or 
                strong Wear Part 
                | for an item, it will be treated as spare part in this portal.
            li In order to create and manage the 
                strong Spare Part Requests 
                | processes, you have to add the given workspace to your tenant as described below.
        h1 Limitations 
        p Note that there is no capability to track the progress of 
            strong Spare Part Requests 
            | in this application. The given button 
            strong Pending Requests 
            | has no function. Tracking of requests in only possible in the standard user interface of PLM for now. This might change in future releases of this application.
            br
            | The application indicates the stock availability of each spare part using colors. As this solution does not have a real time connection to an ERP, the given information is generated randomly.
        h1 Create BOM View 'Service' for workspace Items

            strong Service 
            | for workspace 
            strong Items 
            |and add at least the columns shown below. The sequence of columns does not matter. You may add further fields if needed, but this may impact performance / load times of the portal.

        h1 Add button to launch the portal 
        p Users can access the service portal by passing the dmsId and wsId of a given record, allowing to encode this information in a qr-code for example (see the end of this page for the given URL). 
            br
            |In addition, you may want to provide a button within the details page of an item to open the given portal from there. For this, add a new field 
            strong Actions 
            | which contains the computed formula shown below. In case your tenant has the given field already, please add this button to the existing 
            strong Actions 
            | field.
        p Note that this computed field requires the field 
            strong DMS_ID 
            | which must contain the dmsId of the current record. As the other solutions of this package require this field as well, it is assumed that the given field exists already. If not, please add the field as single line text and let it be set upon item creation.
        p Keep in mind to update the workspace id contained in the formula below if needed. It refers to workspace ID 57 which matches the standard 
            strong Items 
            | workspace. If you are using another id, please adjust the value of parameter wsId.
        p.code CASE

        h1 Add New Workspace Spare Parts Requests
        p The Service Portal can be used to initiate spare parts requests processes with reference to the currently selected spare parts. Howeever, this feature requires the given workspace to manage these requests. If you do not want to manage these requests in PLM, you may skip this chapter. 
        p If you are using a trial or demo tenant, you can take benefit of the preview version of a Spare Parts Requests solution in the template library. Simply download this given template to your tenant and make sure that you replace the placeholder text fields with the given linking picklists (i.e. field LNKED_ITEM in the details tab and ITEM in the grid tab). Afterwards, you can proceed with the next chapter, too.
        p In any other case perform the following steps to manually create a new workspaces for management of the spare parts requests.
        h2 Add Workspace

        p Add the following fields to the new workspace. You may add further fields (non-mandatory) and sections when needed. You may also omit 'Requestor' in all the field labels, they are just used to keep the internal Field ID identical to the label to make the setup easier.

        h1 Landing Page Configuration
        p You may provide a landing page as part of the Service Portal, enabling users to navigate to the product of interest. If this is configured properly, users do no longer require direct access to a given BOM using the workspace ID and dms ID. Instead, they can click on a given product and with this open the matching service information of the related BOM.
        img(src='images/apps/services-portal-8.png' style='width:100%;max-height:722px;margin:10px 0px;')
        p In addition, they can track their formerly created spare parts requests.
        img(src='images/apps/services-portal-9.png' style='width:100%;max-height:915px;margin:10px 0px;')
        p With the default configuration, this capability involves the Products workspace. All products matching a defined search critieria will be displayed on the Landing Page. In addition, these products must link to the matching EBOM which will be used to open the given serivce information for the selected product.
        p Various configuration settings drive this landing page: productsFilter, productsSortBy, productsGroupBy, productsFieldImage, ... wsIdProducts. See their description in the next chapter.
        p The default configuration of the landing page uses the following settings: 
            ol 
                li All products of workspace 95 having an Engineering BOM will be shown (settings products.workspaceId and products.filter)
                li These products will be grouped by Product Line (setting products.groupBy)
                li Each product tile will show the image of field IMAGE as well as the products' TITLE and DESCRIPTION property values (settings products.fieldIdTileImage , products.fieldIdTileTitle and products.fieldIdTileSubtitle)
                li When users click a product, its field ENGINEERING_BOM will be used to open the related BOM and to open the matching Service Portal for this item (setting products.fieldIdBOM)
                li The header of the landing page's list of products is set to 'Serviceable Products' (settings products.headerLabel)
        p You can disable access to this landing page with the home button by setting 'features.homeButton = false'. See chapter 
            strong Feature Availability 
            |for details.
